# 一般発売

**一般発売**  – _ippan-hatsubai_. Used for ticket sales, **general sale** is open to the public and depending on the event and its popularity, it may happen in waves because tickets for high-demand events can sell out almost immediately. Each wave only releases a certain amount, and if seats are allocated randomly, getting in early does not guarantee a good seat. Sometimes additional waves occur because the organizers negotiate for more seats or _kankeisha_ seats have been released after they have confirmed the amount.  
  
Seat availability is marked by symbols (from highest to lowest): ◎→〇→△→▲→☆. You will see **完売** (_kanbai_) if it is **sold out**, however it is important to note that it is only sold out in that particular outlet (if there is more than one seller) and day-of tickets (see below) may still be available.
