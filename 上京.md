**上京** – _jōkyō_. Refers to **moving to the capital,** Tokyo, where the big agencies are and where most of the work is based. _Seiyuu_ come from all over so moving to Tokyo and living on their own becomes part of the process, making it a common interview topic as they relate how different things are from their hometown and the difficulties that come with it.
