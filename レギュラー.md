# レギュラー

**レギュラー** –  _regyurā_. The **regular cast** who appear frequently in a given show. It does not necessarily mean only the main and supporting characters as a _seiyuu_ might just regularly voice various extras. For some, this says that they’ve finally “made it.”

Being a regular also applies to radio shows and programs when a show gets a regular time slot (weekly or monthly), or when certain guests get frequently invited.
