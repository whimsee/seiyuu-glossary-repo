# キャラクターソング = キャラソン = イメージソング

**キャラクターソング** // **キャラソン** // **イメージソング** – _kyarakutā songu // kyarason // imējison._ **character song** or **image song**. Songs sung by a _seiyuu_ portraying their respective character. These are meant to add to the image of the character by giving them a unique take in the form of a song and its lyrics and composition. Some theme songs are also character songs.

These are peculiar in the sense that character songs aren’t counted as actual work for seiyuu singers or artists under their name. It is credited after them but they are technically sung by the character they voice [ie. _Kimagure ROMANTIC_ by Takagi-san (CV: Rie Takahashi)]. As such, it doesn’t count as a _seiyuu_’s official debut work as a solo singer with some exceptions where it eventually gets released under their name.
