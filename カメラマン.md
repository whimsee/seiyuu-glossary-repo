# カメラマン

**カメラマン** – _kameraman_. **photographer** or **videographer**, whichever is applicable. They handle and operate the camera for shoots in movies, TV, magazines, newspapers, etc. 

Literally speaking, **cameraman** is valid, however there is a nuance that it refers to a male especially in Japanese (_man_ is in the word). To be more precise or if the photographer/videographer is female,  **フォトグラファー** (_fotogurafā_) or **ビデオグラファー** (_bideogurafā_) is used instead.
