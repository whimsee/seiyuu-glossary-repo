# シチュエーション

**シチュエーション** – _shichuēshon_. lit. **situation**, **premise**, or **scenario**. You often encounter this in program or event segments where they act out a situation, often the kind that gets them to do something cute and/or embarrassing. These are essentially ad-lib so they’re free to do anything creative as long as it is entertaining.  
  
This may also refer to scenarios done for Situation CDs (see [situation CD](https://whimsicaltranslations.wordpress.com/seiyuu-subculture-term-glossary/#situationcd)), which can range from mundane to extraordinary.
