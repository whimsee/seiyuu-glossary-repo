**トレーディングブロマイド** // **ブロマイド** – _torēdingu buromaido // buromaido._ **Trading bromides, Bromide prints**, or simply **bromides**, are essentially printed photos. The name comes from Silver Bromide used to develop photographs from film. Lately, bromides sold at events are actually digital photos printed on photo paper.  It is an event merchandise staple and they are sold in random packs and/or sets, with some possibly containing an autograph. 

This is one easy way to socialize with folks because it is fun collecting these. You will most likely get duplicates so you can trade with those looking to complete their collection. Or you can sell them to resale shops where you can also find bromides of every kind and rarity.

Common sizes: L (89 × 127 mm | 3.5 x 5 inches) and  2L (127 × 178 mm | 5 x 7 inches)
