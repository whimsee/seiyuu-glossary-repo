# 芝居

**芝居** – s_hibai_. Refers to **acting** as art as opposed to _engi_ (_see below_) which is more about the performance. You see this more often used in stage productions but you’ll also see this in voice acting when _seiyuu_ talk about wanting to get better at acting as a whole or when comparing themselves to others as an actor.
