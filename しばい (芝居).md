# 芝居

**芝居** – *shibai*. Refers to **acting** as art as opposed to *engi* (see [link]) which is more about the performance. You see this more often used in stage productions but you’ll also see this in voice acting when *seiyuu* talk about wanting to get better at acting as a whole or when comparing themselves to others as an actor.
