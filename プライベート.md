# プライベート

**プライベート** – _puraibēto._ Refers to one’s **private life** or **privacy**. It can also refer to how one spends their time outside work or away from the public eye. Most _seiyuu_ are private persons, even under the limelight, rarely opening up even in shows and interviews. Some go as far as not disclosing their real name (**Natsuki Hanae**) or year of birth (**Arthur Lounsbery**). Some are candid and always ready to talk about themselves every chance they get. The industry is a small place so connections between people within it are not surprising, especially with how often many _seiyuu_ openly invite each other to hang out and/or eat together.
