# 結婚

**結婚** – _kekkon_. **Marriage** in the _seiyuu_ world isn’t as impactful (or even as punishing) as with other fields of entertainment. If anything, a revelation that a _seiyuu_ is in a romantic relationship with someone is usually a hot topic that dies down quickly with little controversy, assuming there’s no **scandal** (スキャンダル; _sukyandaru_). That said, it is something people keep secret until they make that big announcement, usually in a form of a handwritten letter telling their fans that they’ve had their **name entered in the family register** (入家; _nyūka_ // 籍に入れる; _seki ni ireru_). This does not necessarily mean a marriage ceremony happened or will happen, but they have filed for marriage.

A lot of _seiyuu_ marriages happened recently due to the period change from _Heisei_ to _Reiwa_: to other _seiyuu_, to athletes, to fellow collaborators, to singers, or to people uninvolved with the industry (or what often gets directly translated into “an ordinary person”).
