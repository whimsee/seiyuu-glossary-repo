**非公式**  – _hikōshiki_. **Unofficial** or **fan-handled**. There are many kinds of unofficial accounts and websites that cover just about anything – from SNS accounts that run photo and video galleries, to websites that collate information about _seiyuu_ fashion, to twitter news aggregates that never miss a beat about their _seiyuu_’s activities.

Most of these are done in good faith though some go against management policy regarding reposting so you do see the occasional warning every so often. However, they are immensely useful sources of information that you even hear industry folks go on record and say they use them.
