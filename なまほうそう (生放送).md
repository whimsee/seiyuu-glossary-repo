# 生放送

**生放送** – _namahōsō_. **Live broadcast** of a program.  As it is aired live, there is no room for edits and all adjustments are done on the fly. It tests the _seiyuu_’s ability to stick to a script, manage time, and think on their feet if needed. For the viewer, however, it comes with the perk of seeing reactions as **comments** (コメント; _komento_) in real-time and interacting with them is part of the fun, hence why some prefer doing this over pre-recording.

Due to its roots as a TV broadcasting term, _namahōsō_ is a specific term used for programs and radio shows since they are more structured than most live streaming content, and it also sounds more official. See below for _namahaishin_.
