**パンフレット** – _panfuretto_. **Pamphlet**, **brochure**, **booklet**, **playbill,** or **programme**. It’s a broad term so the exact translation varies but “pamphlet” is more commonly used even though it usually comes in the form of a booklet. It contains information about the event, words from the cast and/or staff, interviews, lyrics, behind-the-scenes pictures, credits, etc. This is uncommon but some pamphlets may also come with _tokuten_ CD/DVDs.

Common size: A4 (210mm × 297mm | 8.27 × 11.69 inches)
