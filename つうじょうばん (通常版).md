# 通常版

**通常版** – _tsūjō-ban_. **regular edition.** These are the regular versions that don’t come with any extras and are generally significantly cheaper. That said, you may be able to get _tokuten_ items if you preorder or have purchased them during the release period. 

For CDs, you might see 通常盤 (_tsūjō-ban_) instead.
