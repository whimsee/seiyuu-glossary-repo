# 通常版

**通常版** – *tsūjō-ban*. **regular edition.** These are the regular versions that don’t come with any extras and are generally significantly cheaper. That said, you may be able to get _tokuten_ items if you preorder or have purchased them during the release period. 

For CDs, you might see 通常盤 (tsūjō-ban, note the final kanji) instead.
