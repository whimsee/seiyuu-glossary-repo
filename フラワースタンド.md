**フラワースタンド** – _furawā sutando_. **Flower stands,** or more colloquially, **flasta** (フラスタ; _furasuta_) are large standing floral arrangements that may or may not involve other material as some are actually made with or entirely of balloons, paper, etc. These are done as a show of appreciation during events and celebrations. Designs can range from simple to extravagant; some even involve lights and  moving parts. Regardless of design, artboards or panels are displayed to indicate who contributed and who it is addressed to. Flower stands are delivered to the venue (though some may be assembled on-site if the design requires it), however there is a size restriction that must be observed (alterations are done if it goes over), and collection and disposal must be arranged beforehand.

Since フラワースタンド is an _otaku_ term it might be unfamiliar to some people, especially organizers and florists. If you plan on organizing one, the more general term is **スタンド花** (_sutando-hana_; lit. flower stand).

Smaller arrangements are called **flower arrangements** or **flowers** (フラワー; _furawā_ // (お)花; _(o)hana_) and they may be just as intricate as well. Some are portable enough that people might take it with them.
