# オーディオドラマ

**オーディオドラマ** – _ōdio dorama_. **audio drama**. Traditionally, this was the kind of work expected of voice actors during the heyday of **radio dramas** (ラジオドラマ; _rajio dorama_) where you only hear the voice of the actor and nothing else. Nowadays, you still encounter this format along with many other recordings of literary works such as **_rōdoku_ CDs** (朗読CD), and **audiobooks** (オーディオブック; _ōdio bukku_). Drama CDs are also gaining more traction as they tend to be supplemental material for anime, games, and manga. They all come in physical and/or digital formats.
