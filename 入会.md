# 入会

**入会** – _nyūkai._ **Subscribe**. Channels normally have members-only (会員限定; _kai’in-gentei_) content that require a monthly subscription in order to access. The content could be archives, extras, portions of the main show, special content and merchandise, advance tickets, chekis, blog posts. These subscriptions are usually charged at the beginning of the month regardless and they immediately terminate once you **unsubscribe** (退会; _taikai_).  
  
You may also encounter **登録** (_tōroku_), which normally means register (as in for accounts) but also applies to subscribing ala プレミアム会員の登録 (_puremiamu kai’in no tōroku_; premium membership registration)

[Currently, Nico Nico is accepting subscription payments via Paypal so if you’re from outside Japan and you’ve always wanted to watch your favorite _seiyuu_ do goofy things, now’s your chance!]
