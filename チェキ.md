**チェキ** – _cheki_. **_cheki_** or **instant camera photos**. Derived from FUJIFILM Instax Cheki, it is akin to what some might call Polaroids as they are taken and developed on the spot. They are unique items that are done as part of a special event, such as meet-and-greets and fan meets, where you take a photo with the celebrity. They may also be special promotional prizes done by  programs, which are usually signed.

Common sizes: Mini (46 × 62 mm | 1.8 × 2.4 in). Wide (99 × 62 mm | 3.9 × 2.4 in)
