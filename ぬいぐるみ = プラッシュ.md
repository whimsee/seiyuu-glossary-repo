**ぬいぐるみ** // **プラッシュ** – _nuigurumi // purasshu._ **stuffed toy**, **plush,** or **plushies**. They are soft toys made from fabric and stuffed with flexible material (synthetic fiber, batting, cotton, straw, wood wool, plastic pellets, and beans). They come in a variety of sizes, designs, and shapes, usually of the character itself. And they normally come with a strap or a similar element that makes it easier to attach to other objects.
