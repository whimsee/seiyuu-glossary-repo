# 退所

**退所** – _taisho_. Used when a _seiyuu_ is **leaving their agency** either to look for other agencies or go freelance.

If they have left their agency but have not retired from the industry, they’re essentially considered **freelancers** (フリーランス; _furiiransu_ or フリー; furii)**.** This is a path usually taken by more popular _seiyuu_ (**Yoshimasa Hosoya** and **Daisuke Ono** being two of the more popular freelance _seiyuu_) or those who are currently looking for another one.
