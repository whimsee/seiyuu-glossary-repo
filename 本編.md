# 本編

**本編** – _honpen_. Used in programs, events, and CD releases to denote the **main content** which is the show itself if there are other items on the disk such as bloopers, behind the scenes, curtain call or panoramic view. It could also mean the main disk itself if it came with extra or bonus disks. Synonymous with _[honban](https://whimsicaltranslations.wordpress.com/seiyuu-subculture-term-glossary/#honban)_.
