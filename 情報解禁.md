# 情報解禁

**情報解禁** – _jōhō-kaikin_. Useful kanji to note because it means **information has been released/revealed to the public** or **allowed to be released to the public**. Nothing special about it per se but you might see this instead of words that mean **notice** or **announcement** such as _oshirase_ (お知らせ), _happyou_ (発表), _kokuchi_ (告知). In fact, you may omit the literal meaning of the word and convey the message as such.
