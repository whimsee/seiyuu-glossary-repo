# コーナー

**コーナー** – _kōnā._ **corner** or **segment**. A _seiyuu_ program tends to follow a standard format where they do some catch-up, read mail, and do announcements. What makes them different from other programs are the segments. These could be anything from live gaming, live reading, Q&A, music appreciation, cooking, lectures, dancing, anything that brings out their personality’s uniqueness. They may be predetermined as part of their promotion but they are always subject to change, and some are simply variety segments where anything goes.
