# マネジャー

**マネジャー** – _manejā._ **manager** or **agent**. Assigned by an agency as the person responsible for a _seiyuu’_s scheduling, maintenance, support, and for the most part, the work they get especially when they are starting out. They are the liaisons between persons and companies who might want to reach out to a _seiyuu_, and a good and well-connected manager who actively promotes their talent is usually an indicator of success. That said, a _seiyuu_ might gain enough reputation and connections that some work finds them directly. It is not uncommon for a _seiyuu_ to find work because of the positive rapport they had established with the people who make casting decisions. Because of the influence and connections managers have, if they were to leave their agency, their _seiyuu_ might come with them if they get along well.
