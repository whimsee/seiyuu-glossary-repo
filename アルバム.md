**アルバム** – _arubamu._ **record album**. A record release that contains multiple songs (10 – 20) from one or various artists. These may include all the songs previously released as single records, except the instrumental tracks, as well as new songs produced for the album. Albums with significantly fewer songs (~5) are called **mini-albums** (ミニアルバム; mini arubamu).  So called “BEST albums” are selections of the most popular songs released by an artist over a period of time.
