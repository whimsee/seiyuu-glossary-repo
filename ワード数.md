# ワード数

**ワード数** – _wā-do kazu_. **line count**. It refers to the number of lines (台詞 or セリフ; _serifu_) a _seiyuu_ would have to voice in given script, which are then part of how a seiyuu’s pay is calculated, especially for games and narrations (see [gyara](https://whimsicaltranslations.wordpress.com/seiyuu-subculture-term-glossary/#guarantee)). This is counted regardless of actual length which means short utterances such as はい! (hai!) hold as much weight as long monologues.
