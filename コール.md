# コール

**コール** – _kōru._ **call**. For concerts, this refers to a broad category of cheers and **call-and-response routines** (コールアンドレスポンス; _kōru ando resuponsu_) done during key moments in performances. These actions tend to be synchronized with set cheers and gestures, and they may occur spontaneously and/or designed by the artist and/or fans.

There is an offshoot specific to idol culture called **_wotagei_**  (ヲタ芸) with its own set of cheers and gestures involving glow sticks. Its specifics won’t be covered here but I’ll just note that there is more to this developing rabbit hole.
