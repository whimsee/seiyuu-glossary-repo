# 挿入歌

**挿入歌**– _sōnyūka_. **Insert songs** are songs played in anime and movies that are not theme songs. These are usually songs sung in the world it is set in so they tend to fall under character songs or even BGM (Background Music). They may be released as singles, or part of albums or original soundtrack releases.
