# アテレコ

**アテレコ** – **revoicing** or simply **_atereko/atereco_** since the term comes from 映像に台詞を割り**当て(_ate_)**る+ **レコ** (**_reco_**rding). While interchangeable with _afureko_, _atereko_ specifically refers to the replacement or addition of voices (grunts, chatter, etc.) in foreign dramas, movies, animations, and adaptations. It also refers to dubbing done for _tokusatsu_ films. It also refers to re-recordings done after principal production due to mistakes, and additional dialogue due to last minute rewrites or scheduling conflicts. It is essentially ADR (Automated Dialogue Replacement) for those familiar with the term in western voice acting.
