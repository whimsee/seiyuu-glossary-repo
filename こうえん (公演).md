# 公演

**公演** – _kōen._ **public performance** or **show.** This term is often used to refer to a specific performance or show. For example, when people talk about the Yokohama stop of a tour, they’ll say “Yokohama _kōen_.” For events that have multiple sessions in one day, it will refer to all the sessions of the day. In press releases, it can also be used to refer to a show’s run length.
