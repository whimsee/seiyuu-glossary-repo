# 反省会

**反省会**– _hensei-kai._ **evaluation meeting, postmortem session, review meeting, debriefing**. Refers to meetings held after an activity (event, program, recording session, game, rehearsal. etc.) is done where those who participated in it, as well as support staff if applicable, get to reflect on what happened, evaluate their performance, and identify areas where they could do better. These could be held immediately after the activity has wrapped up while it is fresh or as a separate meeting at a later time (possibly to incorporate feedback from other sources). They are different from _uchiage_ (see _[uchiage](https://whimsicaltranslations.wordpress.com/seiyuu-subculture-term-glossary/#uchiage)_) in that the purpose is refinement rather than celebration.  
  
You’ll often encounter this in the context of events but it is a general term that you will find anywhere. These are not public events so while you may hear anecdotes referring to them or even see them as part of behind-the-scenes material, it’s not something you can be a part of.
