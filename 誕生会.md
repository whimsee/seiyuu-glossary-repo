# 誕生会

**誕生会** – _tanjō-kai_. It is a **celebration of one’s birth** and it may involve a fan meet (see below) where the birthday celebrant gets to spend time with their fans. Due to scheduling conflicts, such events don’t always happen on their actual birthday but they are unique experiences. These occasions also encourage fans to put up shrines and post them on social media in hopes that it gets seen there. 

You might also see **_seitan-kai_** (生誕会), which is a more respectful term normally used to refer to someone great. Going into specific nuances, _tanjō_ can be used for anything other than people such as animals, items, events, and groups. _Seitan_ can only be used for people. Both can be used interchangeably unless the person has passed away, where _seitan_ becomes more appropriate.
