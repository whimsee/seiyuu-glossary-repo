# 役

**役** – _yaku_. **role**. You often hear a _seiyuu_ say, “_[Character name] yaku no [Seiyuu name] desu_” when introducing themselves. It is the character they’ve been assigned to portray in a given work. It’s a general term that is used not just in voice work but in other forms of media such as theater and drama recordings, which is important to note because a character in a drama CD might not be voiced by the same seiyuu in the anime version.
