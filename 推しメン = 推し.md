# 推しメン = 推し

**推しメン** // **推し** –  _oshimen_ // _oshi_. This term can be translated in many different ways. Derived from _oshimen_ (oshi-MEMBER), which applies to groups, it has since been adopted to solo personalities as well as it refers to who a fan considers their **favorite**. It is someone they have high hopes for and wishes to succeed in their endeavors. They might express that support in many ways: by attending events, rooting for them every chance they get, sending letters and presents, buying merchandise, growing a fanbase, etc. It doesn’t necessarily mean going crazy for them, but one probably can’t stay calm in front of their _oshi_ either.

This also applies to **one’s favorite character** in an anime or game, referred to as **_oshi-chara_** (推しキャラ; _oshikyara_).
